# Introduction

# The strengths of PYthon are its power and simplicity
# OOP helps keep programs organized, extensible, and easy to adapt and change 
# as projects get longer and more complex and new team members are brought on

# What you should already know:
# Working with IDEs and text editors, development tools
#       Ex. Visual Studio Code
# Python programming fundamentals
#       Ex. how to writing functions, using conditional statements
# Basic object-oriented design principles
#       Ex. classes and methods

# Setting up the development environment:
# Has a github repository of start and finish examples:
# github.com/LinkedInLearning/python-object-oriented-programming-4413110/tree/
# I am using Python 3.9.6, not sure if that is up to date enough
